Although we will be celebrating Remembrance Day on November 11th, we also wish to acknowledge November 8th, yesterday, which is National Aboriginal Veterans Day.\n\nOver 12,000 Indigenous people are estimated to have volunteered in all three wars, including 7,000 First Nations members, and approximately 300 died during these conflicts.\n\nFirst Nations, Inuit and Metis people were not eligible for conscription because they were not citizens of Canada (they were also unable to vote), but many volunteered despite the challenges they faced, including traveling long distances from remote communities to enlist, learning a new language (English), and coping with racism against them. Indigenous people were not allowed to join the Canadian Air Force until 1942 and the Canadian Navy until 1943. Both men and women enlisted, serving as soldiers, nurses and in other roles. Many served with distinction, winning medals for bravery in action.\n\nToday as a community we would like to express our gratitude for the contributions Indigenous Veterans have made to Canada and the world.\n\nPlease Stand to observe a moment of silence Moment of silence"
